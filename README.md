# Foundation Information System (FIS) #
This report discusses Data model transformation and automated generation of operations. First we attempt to clarify and summarize the procedure of making automated model transformations and generations in chapter 1.
Then, we summarize the material of the lectures from the Foundations of Information Systems course in order to gain a better understanding of the theory and highlight the main topics. The lecture theory is then applied
to the automated transformation and generation method and evaluate its applicability. Finally, we propose possible improvements to the theory based on encountered weaknesses.

* Key words: UML, Model Transformation, Information System, Information Structure.
